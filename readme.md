## Bottomhole Pressure Calculation Script for Production and Injection Wells


During the operation of production and injection wells, friction losses occur in the tubing elevator and the perforation interval. Their consideration is necessary in defining bottomhole pressure. This script calculates downhole pressure with allowance for friction losses in the tubing and perforating interval.
